#  Lazy Voice Chatbot
This is a Streamlit application that provides a voice-activated chatbot interface. You can speak into your microphone, and the app will transcribe your speech, send it to a large language model (LLM) for a response, and then read the response back to you using a text-to-speech (TTS) model.

## Features
- Voice Input: Record your voice directly within the app.
- Speech-to-Text: Utilizes OpenAI's Whisper model to transcribe your voice to text.
- AI Response: Interacts with the GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate conversational responses.
- Text-to-Speech: Converts the AI's text response back into an audio file.
- Configurable Behavior: Customize the AI's persona and voice type from the sidebar.
